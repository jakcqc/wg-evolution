Abstraction Percent
1. Description
  When a peice of software is made how much of it is abtracted versus public.
  
2. Use Cases
  [user writes code]->[abstract data model] -> [total abstraction]
      |                                             |
      |>[no abstraction]->[total non abstraction] --|>(abstraction percent)
      
3. Formula
  Abstraction/(nonAbstraction+Abastraction) = percentAbstraction
  
4. Sample Filter and Visualization
  A simple percentage of abstraction
5. Sample Implementation
  If(Abstraction keywords)
    then{Inrease abstraction count to public keywords on classes, data, variables, etc}
    
    print(total abstraction percent
    )
    
6. Known Implementations
  There is certain code editors, IDEs, and open source software who try and measure good coding practices, but not abtraction.
  
7. Test Cases (Examples)
  Any software using abstract data with their software.
